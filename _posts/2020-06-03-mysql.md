## Daily notes 2020/06/03


### I had a quest. 
the quest migrate data of A table, so I had to make backup table in backup database.<br>
there was a problem which is table had about 300 millons row.<br>

first I thought that select all row and then insert into new table, but is it ok? there were too many...<br>

after Searching and asking, I got solution, which is below query.<br>

SELECT INTO #tmp FROM A <br>

the query create #tmp table with all row of A.
