# Today’s Topic is Olive Oil.



During our honeymoon, we had the chance to properly taste olive oil. In Europe, they often dip bread in olive oil with balsamic vinegar. It’s so delicious!



## First, let’s learn about the benefits of olive oil.

Olive oil has been valued as a precious oil in West Asia and the Mediterranean region, as evidenced by the biblical phrase “anointed with oil.” Additionally, it has a good aroma and taste, and it is even said to be safe to eat on its own.



Olive oil is popular because it is low in saturated fats (14g per 100g). It is also known as a longevity food in Europe, including in Greece and Italy. I have high levels of bad cholesterol (LDL), but olive oil does not affect LDL levels and helps increase good cholesterol (HDL) levels. It also acts as an antioxidant and supplies vitamin E (prevents cell oxidation), among other benefits.



## What types of olive oil are there?

- Extra Virgin
- Pure, Super Light
- Pomace

Naturally, the best olive oil is at the top. Extra Virgin Olive Oil is 100% oil mechanically extracted without chemical (heat) processing. It is, of course, the most expensive. As you go down the list, refined olive oils are added.
